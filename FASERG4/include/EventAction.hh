/**
 * @brief Handles the details of a single event
 *
 * This class takes care on the ways how a event is handled.
 * Two main functions can be used and are called by the G4 kernel:
 * BeginOfEventAction() and EndOfEventAction().
 * They do what they say, setting up everything for the event and cleaning up afterowrds.
 * Here they are mostly used to reset the particle manager and fill the trees inside the particle manager to save the simulation data.
